First things first, thank's tom@shoutclub.com for making the xml parser, without that script we wouldnt be parsing away.
Installation notes:
1. if your this far you have obviously unzipped the file dhu!! <<hate it when people tell you to unzip the file in there install or read
me text files. like where supposed to see the readme.txt or install.txt before we unzip the file. just my $2 worth.
2. make sure you have php installed, this has been tested in red hat linux and should work with any nix type os.
   if you get it to work on win nt or win 2000 with iis hooray for you!!! so let me know dstjohn@mediacast1.com
3. edit the config.php file to suit your sites needs, you will need your shoutcast servers ip, port and password 
4. then ftp into your account and just upload the whole directory.
5. you can use this as a standalone page or use the include function like so >> include ("scast/sc_song.php");
6. the file sc_song.php is your main file i.e. index
8. thats it your done!!
